Q> There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b,
and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.
A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3
