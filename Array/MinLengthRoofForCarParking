ou are given an List of positions of cars as to where they are parked. You are also given an integer K. 
 The cars needs to be covered with a roof. You have to find the minimum length of roof that takes to cover K cars.
 
 Input : 12,6,5,2      K = 3
 Output : 5
 
 Approach: SLiding window
 
 int min_roof_length(parking_spots, k){
 
    parking_spots.sort()
    int ans=Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    for(int i=0;i< parking_spots-k+1;i++)
        ans = Math.min(ans, parking_spots[i + k - 1] - parking_spots[i] + 1);
   
    return ans
    
    }
