Q. You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.
   You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
   
 Eg:
  Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
  Output: 5

// Variation of stock buy and sell problem, similar pattern to find max diff between i&j s.t. i<j & A[j]>A[i].

class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int profit=Integer.MAX_VALUE,result=0;
        for(int i=0;i<prices.length;i++){
            profit=Math.min(profit,prices[i]);
            result=Math.max(result,prices[i]-profit);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
