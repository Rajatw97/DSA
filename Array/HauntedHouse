Q>There are  people who want to visit the haunted house. The  person will only go if at least  other people will go with him. 
Additionally, that person doesn't want to go with more than  other people, since it would ruin the experience for them.
What is the maximum number of people that can visit the haunted house at one time so that no constraint is violated?

public class Solution {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
            int a[]=new int[300010];
        int ans=0;
            Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
            int n=sc.nextInt();
            for(int i=0;i<n;i++)
             {
                int c,d;
                c=sc.nextInt();
                d=sc.nextInt();
                a[c]+=1;
                a[d+1]-=1;
            }
            for(int i=1;i<=300002;i++)a[i]+=a[i-1];   
            for(int i=0;i<=300002;i++)
                {
                if(a[i]>=i+1)ans=Math.max(ans,i+1);
            }
        System.out.println(ans);
    }
}
