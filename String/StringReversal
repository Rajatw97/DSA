Q> A series of num_operations are performed on a initial_string of length n that contains lowercase English letters only. In the ith Operation, the prefix of the string of length i is reversed. The final string thus formed is represented by final_string.
Given the string final_string and an integer num_operations, find the initial_string on which the operations were performed.
Ex:

Suppose final_string="chakerrank" and num_operations=3.
Then the initial_string will be "hackerrank".
On the first operation, reverse "h" -> "hackerrank"
Reverse "ha" -> "ahckerrank".
Reverse "ahc" -> "chakerrank" which is equal to final_string.
Hence the answer is "hackerrank".

Constraints:
Sample Input:
final_string=bbaaaba
num_operations=5
Output: aababba
• After operation 1, reverse the prefix of length =
1: aababba -› initial_string = aababba
• After operation 2, reverse the prefix of length =
2: aababba -› initial_string = aababba
• After operation 3, reverse the prefix of length =
3: aababba -> initial_string = baaabba
• After operation 4, reverse the prefix of length =
4: baaabba -› initial_string = aaabbba
• After operation 5, reverse the prefix of length =
5: aaabbba -› initial_string = bbaaaba


Solution:
string getInitialString(string final_string, int num_operations) { 

String temp = final_string;
int flag = 0;
int k = 0;
for(int i = num_operations-1 ; i >= 0 ; i-=2){
    temp[i] = final_string[k];
    k++;
    flag = i;
}
if(flag == 0){
    for(int j = 1 ; j < num_operation ; j+=2){
        temp[j] = final_string[k];
        k++;
    }
}
else{
    for(int j = 0 ; j < num_operation ; j+=2){
        temp[j] = final_string[k];
        k++;
    }
}
return temp;
}
