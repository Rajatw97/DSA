Q>Design a hit counter which counts the number of hits received in the past 5 minutes.
Each function accepts a timestamp parameter (in seconds granularity) and you may assume that calls are being made to the system in chronological order 
(ie, the timestamp is monotonically increasing). You may assume that the earliest timestamp starts at 1.
It is possible that several hits arrive roughly at the same time.

Time: O(1), Space: O(1)
class HitCounter {

  private int[] timestamps = new int[300];
  private int[] hits = new int[300];
  
  public void hit(int timestamp) {
    final int i = timestamp % 300;
    if (timestamps[i] == timestamp) {
      ++hits[i];
    } else {
      timestamps[i] = timestamp;
      hits[i] = 1; // Reset hit count to 1
    }
  }

  public int getHits(int timestamp) {
    int countHits = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < 300; ++i)
      if (timestamp - timestamps[i] < 300)
        countHits += hits[i];
    return countHits;
  }
}
