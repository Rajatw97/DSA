Q. Given a characters array letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order and a character target, return the smallest character in the array that is larger than target.
   Note that the letters wrap around.
   For example, if target == 'z' and letters == ['a', 'b'], the answer is 'a'.
   
   Approach: Similar to ceiling of a no

class Solution {
    public char nextGreatestLetter(char[] letters, char target) {
     
        int start=0,end=letters.length-1;
        
        while(start<=end){
            
            int mid=(start+end)/2;
            
            if( letters[mid]> target)
                end=mid-1;
            else
                start=mid+1;
        }
        
        return letters[start % letters.length];
        
        
    }
}
