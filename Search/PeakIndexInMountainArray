Q. Let's call an array arr a mountain if the following properties hold:

arr.length >= 3
There exists some i with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
arr[0] < arr[1] < ... arr[i-1] < arr[i]
arr[i] > arr[i+1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]

Eg: arr:[1,2,5,7,6,4] O/P:7

Exact same question to Finding peak element


class Solution {
    public int peakIndexInMountainArray(int[] arr) {
        
        int start=0,end=arr.length-1;
        
        while(start<end){
            
            int mid=(start+end)/2;
            
            //Check for dec order array which could be a possible answer hence end!=mid-1
            if(arr[mid]>arr[mid+1])
                end=mid;
            else
            //Check for inc order array but greater number lies in right hence start=mid+1
                start=mid+1;           
            
        }
        // Both start and end will point to the largest element, so can return any one of the 2.
        return start;
    }
}
