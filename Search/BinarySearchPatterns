To identify if your problem contains binary search look for following pattern in the problem:

1. Given array is sorted in any order. Eg: Ceiling, Floor
2. Bitonic array (array containing both asc and desc order) Eg- Peak Element, Mountain Array, Search in sorted and rotated array
3. Array is not sorted but you need to distribute in fixed no of parts, so find range in which your answer can lie and then call binary search. Eg- Choc Distr, Split Array Largest Sum
